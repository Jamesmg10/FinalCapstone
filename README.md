# 'Tipping the Scale' ~ Army Height and Weight Standards vs. The New Army Combat Fitness Test. 
# <font size="3"> An Analysis By: James Gamarra <ul><em> Data Set: 2021 Mens CrossFit Open Results</em></ul></font> 
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <ul><p> The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT), began development in 2013. This was in response to the growing need for a physical assessment that incorporated the demands of the modern Army. The previous physical assessment, Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), was implemented in 1980 and composed of 3 events.</p>
    <p>
    <li>
    Push - Ups
    </li>
    <li>
    Sit - Ups 
    </li>
    <li>
    2 - Mile Run
    </li></p>
    <p>The new ACFT is composed of 6 events.</p>
    <p><li>
    3 Repetition Maximum Deadlift
    </li>
    <li>
    Standing Power Throw 
    </li>
    <li>
    Hand-Release Push-up
    </li>
    <li>Sprint- Drag-Carry</li>
    <li>Leg Tuck or Plank</li>
    <li>2 Mile Run</li>
    </p>
    <p>These events are derived from the Army's '113 Warrior Tasks and Drills' and closely resemble a Cross-Fit workout. While the Army has effectively changed the way soliders workout. The scale in which we monitor the effects of this level of fitness have not been altered.</p>
    <p>Through analysis, my aim is to observe any dissonance between the Height and Weight standards from the APFT era and the new ACFT era by examining a data set of the world's best crossfit athletes.</p>

<h2> Part 1:<em> Current Height and Weight Standards</em>
</h2>
<p>
I began my analysis by examining the current standards in place. The current Height and Wieght standards are outlined in the Army Regulation 40-501. A healthy weight is evaluated in four age groups.
</p>
    <li>17 - 20</li>
    <li>21 - 27</li>
    <li>28 - 39</li>
    <li>40 and Over</li>
<p>
Within each age group, a solidiers maximum allowed weight is correlated to their height(in inches).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I cleaned my data frame to fit the model in which the army makes its evaluations.
<ul>
1. All heights were converted to inches.
</ul>
<ul>
2. The data frame was grouped by age.
</ul>
<ul>
3. Ommitted all data incorrectly inputted and outstanding outliers to ensure data accuracy.
</ul>
<ul>
4. Only included the top 20% of Athletes to ensure the quality of the Athlete. 
</ul>
</p>
Once cleaned my data frame had a remaining 28,355 entries.

</p>

<h2> Part 2:<em> Regressional Analysis</em>
</h2>
<p>
Once my data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. I utlized a Linear Regression to predict the weight of a high performing athletes in 3 age groups. 
</p>
<p>
Coefficients
<ul>
1. Height
</ul>
<ul>
2. Weight
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
All Age Regression. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Things to note:
<ul>
- While there is an obvious correlation between Height and Weight. The taller an individual the heavier he is.
</ul>
<ul>
 - The R-squared value only yields a value of .466. This tells me that the strength of my model is not much more conclusive than a straight line composed of averages. 
</ul>
</p>
<h2><em> Conclusion</em></h2>

Further analysis is needed for conlusive evidence suggesting a new maximum weight for soliders based on age group and height. While trends indicate the maximum weight should be increased, further analysis is necessary.
